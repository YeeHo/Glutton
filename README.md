# Glutton
Protein Chemical Shift - Structure Database 

All database files 

LEVEL1_ALL_20180116.dat
LEVEL2_ALL_20180116.dat
LEVEL3_ALL_20180116.dat

are in csv format. 

Each row represents a single residue, and the meaning of each column is as follows:

column 1: residue type (one letter code)

column 2: the chemical shift of the H on the backbone N

column 3: the chemical shift of the backbone N

column 4: the chemical shift of the proton on the backbone C_Alpha

column 5: the chemical shift of the backbone C_Alpha

column 6: the chemical shift of the backbone C'

column 7: Secondary structure type of this residue

column 7: Phi angle of this residue

column 7: Psi angle of this residue

NOTE: if the chemical shift value of a atom is not avaliable, Glutton sets it as 9999.0.
